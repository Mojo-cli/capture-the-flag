# Capture The Flag (CTF) Methodology and Resources
This repository serves as a collection of my CTF (Capture The Flag) methodologies, proofs of concept (PoCs), and associated assets used while solving challenges on platforms such as TryHackMe, Hack The Box, Juice Shop, and others.

### What You'll Find
- Step-by-Step Methodologies: Detailed approaches for solving challenges in diverse domains like web exploitation, privilege escalation, reverse engineering, - forensics, and more.
- Proof of Concept (PoC): Code snippets and scripts developed to demonstrate vulnerabilities or automate parts of the challenge-solving process.
- Tools & Resources: Custom tools, scripts, or notes that simplify the CTF-solving workflow.
- Platform Diversity: Challenges solved across multiple platforms, providing exposure to a wide array of challenges and setups.

### Purpose
This repository is aimed at documenting my learning journey in cybersecurity through CTFs while serving as a resource for fellow enthusiasts seeking structured approaches and inspiration for their problem-solving endeavors.
